        - I would like to be able to enter my email, username, and preferred password on a clearly laid out form.
        * I would like the website to log me in upon successful completion of the sign-up form.
            * So that I can seamlessly access the site's functionality
    - When I enter invalid data on the sign-up form:
        - I would like the website to inform me of the validations I failed to pass, and repopulate the form with my valid entries (except my password).
    - So that I can try again without needing to refill forms I entered valid data into.
